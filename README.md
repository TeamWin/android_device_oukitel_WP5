My thanks primarily to rokibhasansagar whose guide to building TWRP for MTK devices inspired this work, and for vital assistance along the way, including crucial patches and his droid-builder docker container which was used for the build itself: https://gist.github.com/rokibhasansagar/15c8e728d94a6bd35a687aac73ef79a5. I also acknowledge chankruze whose WP1 tree provided a useful template: https://github.com/TeamWin/android_device_oukitel_wp1
