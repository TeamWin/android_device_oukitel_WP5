My thanks primarily to rokibhasansagar whose guide to building TWRP for MTK devices inspired me, a novice, to take the plunge:

Rokib provided vital assitance along the way, including crucial patches, and his droid-builder docker container was also used for the build itself

I also acknowledge chankruze whose WP1 tree provided a useful template for my tree: https://github.com/TeamWin/android_device_oukitel_wp1

The youtube videos of AlaskaLinuxUser were also very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnGqG_jyyXmTzdamBpKfeHA
